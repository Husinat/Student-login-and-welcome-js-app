# Student Login and Welcome App

## Description

The Student Login & Welcome App is a simple JavaScript project that allows users to enter their name and receive a personalized welcome message.
Returning students are recognized, while new students are welcomed and saved for future visits using localStorage.

This project focuses on practicing JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and browser storage.


## Purpose of the Project

## This app was built to:

Practice JavaScript conditionals and arrays

Understand DOM selection and event handling

Learn how to store and retrieve data using localStorage

Improve user interaction and feedback in a web app


## Features

Input field for student name

Welcomes returning students with a personalized message

Detects first-time users and stores their names

Uses localStorage to remember students across sessions

Input validation for empty values

Simple hover effects on the button

Clean UI styled with Tailwind CSS


## What I Learned

## While building this project, I learned:

How to use addEventListener for user interactions

How to manipulate the DOM dynamically

How to work with arrays and the includes() method

How to store and retrieve data using localStorage

How to convert data using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()

How to handle conditional logic effectively

Basic UI styling using Tailwind CSS CDN


## How It Works

The user enters their name into the input field.

When the button is clicked:

If the input is empty, an error message is shown.

If the name already exists, a “Welcome back” message is displayed.

If the name is new, it is saved to localStorage and a first-time welcome message is shown.

Stored names persist even after refreshing the page.
